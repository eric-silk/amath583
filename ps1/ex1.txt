The hostname of this machine (which is running Linux natively) is "ericsilklx2". This was printed
by running "hostname".

The "-o" option allows clang to write the output to the desired file. For instance, appending
"-o pretty_graphs" to the clang command will create an executable called "pretty_graphs" instead
of the default "a.out".

Bash prints "a.out: command not found" as "a.out" is not in the environment variables or $PATH. The
"./" indicates bash should execute the program available in the current directory. Similarly,
providing any relative or absolute path to specify a program not in the environment variables or
$PATH would do the same; e.g. "/home/ericsilk/Documents/UW_Masters/amath583/ps1/a.out".

After selecting clang as my default compiler through "sudo update-alternatives", running
"c++ --version" prints:
clang version 6.0.0-1ubuntu2 (tags/RELEASE_600/final)
Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin

The "-l" flag tells clang to link a library (in this case Python 2.7). Per the man page, the use of
"-I<directory>" does the following: "Add the specified directory to the search path for include
files."
